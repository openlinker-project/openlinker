/**
 * Invoice Service (ADR-026 "SVC")
 *
 * Core application service that orchestrates fiscal document issuance. A DUMB
 * executor: it owns idempotency, the persist-intent-before-call lifecycle, and
 * per-connection adapter resolution — it does NOT decide whether/which document
 * type to issue (`documentType` is a caller-supplied pass-through; the provider
 * adapter derives it when absent). Depends ONLY on ports
 * (`InvoiceRecordRepositoryPort` + `IIntegrationsService`), never concrete
 * adapters; nothing from `libs/integrations` is imported. No `faktura`/`paragon`/
 * `NIP` vocabulary lives here.
 *
 * The accepted-risk contract (R1/R2/R3) is on {@link IInvoiceService}. On a
 * successful issue the service also snapshots the issued-document content (§7.3):
 * seller from the adapter result, buyer/lines from the command, with per-line and
 * VAT-breakdown money computed here (country-agnostic, neutral tax-rate codes only).
 *
 * @module libs/core/src/invoicing/application/services
 * @implements {IInvoiceService}
