/**
 * Generate Label Types
 *
 * Port-input/output types for `ShippingProviderManagerPort.generateLabel`.
 * Lives in a dedicated `*.types.ts` file per engineering-standards §"Type
 * Definitions in Separate Files" (mirrors listings'
 * `offer-create.types.ts` precedent — port files contain only the port
 * interface; their types live here).
 *
 * #764 (InPost) added the `recipient` + `parcel` fields below. They're
 * carrier-neutral — every shipping provider needs a recipient and a parcel
 * descriptor — so they live on the canonical command rather than behind a
 * `platformParams` escape hatch. Provider-specific translation (ShipX
 * `service` / `custom_attributes.target_point`, courier-vs-locker parcel
 * shape, etc.) stays inside each adapter. A future provider needing a
 * genuinely adapter-specific input should add a typed optional field here
 * (or a `GenerateLabelOverrides` interface) — never an untyped bag.
