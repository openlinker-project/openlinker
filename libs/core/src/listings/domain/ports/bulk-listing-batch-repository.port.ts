/**
 * Bulk Offer Creation Batch Repository Port
 *
 * Persistence contract for BulkListingBatch. Implemented in the
 * listings infrastructure layer. Returns domain entities only — ORM
 * mapping stays inside the repository.
 *
 * Intentionally narrow: only the methods needed by callers in scope
 * (#734 foundation + #736 submission service). The "list batches for a
 * connection" surface is deferred until #736 supplies a real caller with
 * concrete query shape (paginated history vs. active-only vs. metrics).
