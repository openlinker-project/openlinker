/**
 * Product Publish Types
 *
 * Command and result types for publishing a master catalog product onto a
 * **shop** destination (WooCommerce, Shopify, …) via
 * `ShopProductManagerPort.publishProduct`. The shop-listing sibling of
 * `offer-create.types.ts`: where a marketplace `createOffer` lists a thin
 * sell-record over a catalog card into a closed taxonomy, a shop publish
 * creates/owns the product record itself — multi-category placement,
 * draft/published status, owned-record content/images/SEO, and price/stock as
 * product fields (ADR-024 §1, §3).
 *
 * Projected/operator category parameters travel on the typed neutral
 * `parameters: OfferParameter[]` field (#1072) — the same domain channel the
 * offer side uses (#1039), not the opaque `platformParams` bag. `OfferParameter`
 * is a domain type, so the command references it without a domain→application
 * edge. `platformParams` is reserved for un-modeled shop knobs only.
 *
 * @module libs/core/src/listings/domain/types
 * @see {@link ShopProductManagerPort} for the port that consumes these.
