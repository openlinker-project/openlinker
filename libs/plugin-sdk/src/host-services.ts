/**
 * HostServices — typed bag of services the host provides to a plugin
 *
 * Defines the curated, framework-neutral surface every adapter plugin can
 * rely on. Two categories live in this bag (separated by comment block):
 *
 *   1. Read inputs — services the plugin USES at runtime when fulfilling
 *      its `createCapabilityAdapter(connection, capability, host)` calls.
 *      Examples: `logger`, `identifierMapping`, `credentialsResolver`,
 *      `cache`.
 *
 *   2. Side registries — services the plugin REGISTERS into once at boot
 *      via its `register(host)` method. Examples: `adapterRegistry`,
 *      `factoryResolver`, `connectionTesterRegistry`,
 *      `webhookProvisioningRegistry`, …
 *
 * Plugin-specific cross-package ports (`CustomerIdentityResolverPort`,
 * `CustomerProjectionRepositoryPort`, `IMappingConfigService`,
 * `WebhookSecretProviderPort`, `IntegrationCredentialRepositoryPort`) are
 * NOT in this bag — the conservative cut (#593). Plugins that need them
 * import via the existing cross-package mechanism and pass them into the
 * descriptor's closure via their factory constructor (e.g.
 * `createAllegroPlugin({ customerIdentityResolver, … })`).
 *
 * Field additions: when a new plugin author asks for a service in this
 * bag, weigh "every plausible future plugin needs this" against keeping
 * the surface lean. Open a follow-up issue rather than silently expand
 * the contract.
 *
