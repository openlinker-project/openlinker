# Manual walkthrough — InPost

Shipping provider connection (sandbox) — `ShippingProviderManager` capability, used to generate
shipping labels/pickup-point (paczkomat) selection for orders.

**Connection**: `test inpost` — id `61db01f1-af06-4242-bd92-7f18690e80e5`
**Config**: sandbox environment, sender address + organization ID already filled.

## Part A — Connection already set up, confirm it

- [x] Open http://localhost:8090/connections/61db01f1-af06-4242-bd92-7f18690e80e5
- [x] Confirm status badge shows **Active**, environment shows **sandbox**

![InPost connection overview, status Active, adapter inpost.shipx.v1 — 0 of 0 capabilities toggleable (shipping has no Enabled-roles toggle model)](screenshots/inpost/01-connection-overview.png)

- [x] Go to the **Actions** tab, click **Test connection** → expect a green success result

> Note: the Actions tab also surfaces a manual webhook-setup flow — InPost doesn't offer
> self-service webhook provisioning, so OpenLinker generates an email template the operator sends
> to `integration@inpost.pl` with the callback endpoint, verified by HMAC on delivery.

## Part B — Generate a shipping label

Used an order that came in from the Allegro E2E testing earlier (adidas tee, buyer-selected
Allegro Paczkomaty InPost delivery method, pickup point `OLS31A` already resolved from Allegro).

- [x] Go to **Orders**, open the order — confirm delivery method + pickup point are correct,
      "No shipment yet"

![Order detail — delivery method "Allegro Paczkomaty InPost", pickup point OLS31A, no shipment yet, Generate label button](screenshots/inpost/03a-order-detail-no-shipment.png)

- [x] Click **Generate label** — dimensions/weight defaulted, paczkomat pre-filled read-only
      (buyer-selected via Allegro), pick a locker size

![Generate label form — recipient details, dimensions, weight, paczkomat OLS31A read-only, locker size Small selected](screenshots/inpost/03b-generate-label-form.png)

- [x] Submit — shipment panel shows **GENERATED** status, "Label ready" stage in the lifecycle
      rail (new `ShipmentLifecycleRail` from PR #1429, merged into this demo earlier)

![Shipment panel — GENERATED status, Label ready stage active, paczkomat OLS31A (operator-selected)](screenshots/inpost/04a-shipment-panel-label-ready.png)

- [x] Click **Download label** — confirm a real InPost label PDF/image downloads with correct
      courier region, destination, barcode, and reference

![Downloaded InPost label — region P37, destination OLS, recipient OLS31A, barcode, reference ol_shipment_...](screenshots/inpost/04b-downloaded-label.png)

- [x] Click **Mark dispatched** — shipment panel advances to **DISPATCHED**, dispatched
      timestamp recorded

![Shipment panel — DISPATCHED status, Dispatched stage active, dispatched-at timestamp shown](screenshots/inpost/05-shipment-panel-dispatched.png)

> **Finding:** none — the whole generate-label → download → mark-dispatched flow worked cleanly
> end to end, including the new `ShipmentLifecycleRail` UI from #1429.

## Part C — Tracking status sync (not run — sandbox limitation)

Not exercised in this run: as the Finding below explains, InPost's sandbox does not appear to
surface tracking progression at all, so this step can't be meaningfully confirmed there. Left
unchecked deliberately.

- [ ] Wait for the `inpost-shipment-status-sync` scheduled job (every 30 min) or trigger manually
- [ ] Confirm the shipment status updates in OpenLinker

_(screenshot pending — step not run; see Finding below)_

> **Finding — sandbox tracking limitation (verified, not "custom integration"-specific):** the
> shipment above doesn't appear in InPost's own web dashboard. Initially suspected this was
> because OpenLinker's InPost connection is a "custom integration" (ShipX API access provisioned
> directly, not through InPost's official partner-dashboard onboarding) — **checked this against
> InPost's own developer docs and it does not hold up**:
> - No InPost documentation ties dashboard visibility to *how* the integration was provisioned.
> - What IS documented: **courier** shipments never appear in any sandbox dashboard (WebTrucker is
>   production-only by design) — but **paczkomat/locker** shipments (what we tested, `OLS31A`)
>   *should* be visible in the **sandbox-specific** Manager Paczek, which lives at a **different
>   URL** than production (`sandbox-manager.paczkomaty.pl`, not the production dashboard) — worth
>   double-checking that URL specifically before concluding it's not visible at all.
> - Separately, InPost's sandbox documentation describes the **tracking component as
>   generally limited/disabled** in sandbox — so full status progression (in transit → delivered)
>   may simply not be simulated there regardless of integration type. This reads as a blanket
>   sandbox constraint, not something OpenLinker can work around.
> - No sandbox-only "simulate a scan event" endpoint was found to manually advance status for
>   testing.
>
> **Net**: Part C likely can't be meaningfully exercised against the InPost *sandbox* at all — this
> looks like an InPost-side sandbox limitation rather than an OpenLinker bug. Confirming this
> conclusively would need InPost's own support/FAQ to weigh in directly (their FAQ page exists but
> its exact current wording couldn't be fetched during this research pass).
